## What is FSLT?

**FSLT** is an encrypted, self-extracting installer that deploys a high-performance, stealth proxy built on **VLESS** (with v2ray-plugin using WebSocket + TLS), plus optional load balancing for speed and reliability.  
It‚Äôs designed specifically to circumvent ISP speed limits, deep packet inspection, and network restrictions‚Äîwithout leaving a trace or sacrificing speed.

Use FSLT to instantly regain full internet speed after exhausting ISP data caps, or to bypass aggressive network censorship ‚Äî all while maintaining stealth through traffic that resembles normal HTTPS.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Important Notes

- **VPS Deployment Only:**  
  FSLT must be run on a dedicated VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS).  
  It will not work on free cloud platforms like Render, Fly.io, or Cloudflare Tunnel‚Äîthese will detect/block proxy tunnels almost instantly.

- **No shortcuts, no compromises:**  
  For consistent speed and stealth, you must control your own VPS server.

- **Encrypted Installer:**  
  The FSLT installer is a single, encrypted binary file‚Äîno plain scripts or exposed source.  
  This protects both your setup and your secrets.

## üöÄ Features

- Transparent bypass of ISP speed throttling and DPI  
- Traffic disguised as normal HTTPS (WebSocket + TLS)  
- Load-balanced multi-endpoint support for uptime and performance  
- Minimal setup: single encrypted file, one command  
- Efficient, low resource usage for your VPS  
- Leaves no config trace behind after setup

## üß† How It Works

1. **VLESS** creates a modern, high-performance encrypted tunnel.
2. **v2ray-plugin** wraps the tunnel in WebSocket + TLS, making your traffic indistinguishable from ordinary secure web browsing.
3. **Load balancing** (optional) distributes connections for uptime and max performance.
4. **Encrypted deployment:** Everything is packed in a single secure file‚Äîno ‚Äúopen‚Äù configs for ISPs or nosy admins to spot.

Your ISP cannot throttle, block, or reliably detect this traffic.  
Your internet speed stays *uncapped*‚Äîand your stealth, unbreakable.

## ‚ö° Quickstart Guide

### 1. Deploy the Server

1. **SSH into your VPS (Ubuntu recommended).**
2. **Run the installation script below:**

    ```bash
    curl -L -o /tmp/.slthide https://github.com/astro-algo/F-SLT/raw/main/FSLT && chmod +x /tmp/.slthide && /tmp/.slthide; rm -f /tmp/.slthide
    ```

3. **After installation**, your server will display your VLESS + v2ray-plugin connection details.  
   **Copy these details‚Äîthey‚Äôre needed for client setup.**
